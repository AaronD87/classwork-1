# Writing functions

Write three functions `addDeclared`, `addExpressed`, and `addArrow`:

1. Declare a function that adds two numbers together
  * write a test to make sure your function works
1. Declare a constant set to a function (function expression) that
  adds two numbers together
  * write a test to make sure your function works
1. Create an arrow function that adds two numbers together
  * write a test to make sure your function works
1. Write a test that checks that the above three functions all return
  the same value.
